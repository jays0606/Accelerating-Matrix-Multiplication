# Accelerating-Matrix-Multiplication

In this project, I implement a multi-threaded matrix multiplication program. Given two N=4096 N*N matrices, a na√Øve approach would take nearly 10 minutes to multiply them. The goal is to reduce this time as much as possible My final performance is 0.597s, which is about 1400% improvement.
